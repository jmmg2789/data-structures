    // TODO - Stacks
    // Can be built with arrays or linked lists
    // I think arrays should be preferred because we are only worried about the last index
    // In reality, both work well and depends on personal preference
    // Arrays are slightly faster in accessing elements and use less memory
    // Linked lists are dynamic in memory which allow us to keep growing the list if needed

    // TODO - Queues
    // Can be built with arrays or linked lists
    // I think linked lists should be used because removing the head node won't take long
